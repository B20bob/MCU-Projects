## TODO for snake enviro-monitors:

- Create new SD card for each snake. Use new Pi zero w (for mr. snake) to program both sd cards.
- Install libraires + requisites on each sd card.
- Clone git repo to both sd cards.
- Set up /etc/rc.local on each sd card to run scripts at boot.
- design + print mounting solutions for each system.
- Wire up and build both systems.
